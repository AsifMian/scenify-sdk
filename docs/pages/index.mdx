# Scenify

**Scenify**  is a [fabric.js](https://nextjs.org)  based SDK  that will help you build canvas-like editors for several business use cases.

There are many powerful JavaScript frameworks and tools that can help you make a canvas editor. But almost all of them are "low-level" and you may need to write a lot of code to make a full canvas editor app.

The idea is to provide a SDK that will abstract all complexities and give you a clean interface for building design editors with almost no code.
