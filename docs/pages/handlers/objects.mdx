# Objects

Objects handler is a cointainer for common actions releted to editor elements. You can access to the objects handlers as specified below:

```tsx
import { useHandlers } from '@scenify/sdk'

const handlers = useHandlers()
const objectsHandler = handlers.objectsHandler
```

### Shadow

Allow you to apply a shadow to the selected object.

```tsx
const options = {
  enabled: true,
  offsetX: 15,
  offsetY: 15,
  blur: 0,
  color: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.45)',
}
objectsHandler.setShadow(options)
```

### Gradient

Allow you to apply a gradient fill to the active object.

```tsx
const options = {
  angle: 0,
  colors: ['#24C6DC', '#514A9D'],
}
objectsHandler.setGradient(options)
```

### Layers

##### Bring Forward

Moves an object or a selection up in stack of drawn objects.

```tsx
objectsHandler.bringForward()
```

##### Bring To Front

```tsx

```

##### Send Backward

```tsx
objectsHandler.sendBackwards()
```

##### Send to back

```tsx

### Positioning

Position handlers allow you to move your objects to some specific locations: Top, Middle, Bottom, Left, Center, Right. If only 1 object is selected, it will update the position relatative to frame, otherwise, relative to the selection.

##### Align top

Moves an object to the top of the frame. If multiple objects are selected, will move all objects to the top of the selection.

```tsx
objectsHandler.alignToTop()
```

##### Align Middle

Moves an object to the middle of the frame. If multiple objects are selected, will move all objects to the middle of the selection.

```tsx

```tsx
objectsHandler.alignToBottom()
```

##### Align Left

Moves an object to the left of the frame. If multiple objects are selected, will move all objects to the left of the selection.

```tsx
objectsHandler.alignToLeft()
```

Moves an object to the center of the frame. If multiple objects are selected, will move all objects to the center of the selection.

```tsx
